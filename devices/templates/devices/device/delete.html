<h1>Delete Device</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Are you sure you want to delete the device: {{ device.name }}? 
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This operation can't be undone. When the device is deleted, all its saved data are removed as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don't want to delete the device, but still want it to be hidden from the list, you can deactivate it instead from <a href="{% url 'devices:device_edit' device.uid %}">here</a>
  </p>
